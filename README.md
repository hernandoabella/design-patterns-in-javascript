## What Are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are proven and robust solutions for addressing common problems in software design and other contexts related to interaction and interfaces. These techniques provide structured and effective approaches to solving recurring challenges, promoting efficiency, reusability, and clarity in software development.

A design pattern is considered a mature and consolidated solution for a specific design problem. To earn the recognition of being a pattern, it must exhibit certain key characteristics. Firstly, it must have demonstrated its effectiveness in solving similar problems in previous situations. Additionally, a pattern should be highly reusable, meaning it is applicable in various contexts and design challenges.

## Types of Design Patterns

There are three main categories of design patterns, each focusing on a particular dimension of software design:

- **Creational Patterns:** These patterns center around how class instances and objects are created. They offer flexible solutions for object creation in various scenarios.

- **Structural Patterns:** Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures. They facilitate the creation of efficient and flexible relationships between parts of the system.

- **Behavioral Patterns:** These patterns focus on the interaction between objects and how they communicate with each other. They help define workflows and collaborative behaviors.

By understanding these types of design patterns, you can effectively address specific problems and apply proven solutions across various areas of software development.

I encourage you to link to specific files for each type of pattern in case you have more detailed information in those documents. This will help readers delve deeper into each category of design patterns.
