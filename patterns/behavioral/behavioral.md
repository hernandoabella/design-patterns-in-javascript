# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns focus on the communication and interaction between objects in a software system. These patterns identify common patterns of communication and collaboration between objects, increasing flexibility and efficiency in designing and implementing the behavior of a system.

Below are the most common behavioral design patterns in JavaScript:

## 1. Chain of Responsibility

The **Chain of Responsibility** pattern allows multiple objects to handle a request without the sender knowing which one will process it.

## 2. Command

The **Command** pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing clients to parameterize objects with operations, queue requests, log requests, and support undoable operations.

## 3. Iterator

The **Iterator** pattern provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

## 4. Mediator

The **Mediator** pattern defines an object that encapsulates how communication occurs between objects in a system, promoting loose coupling by preventing objects from explicitly referring to each other.

## 5. Memento

The **Memento** pattern allows capturing and externalizing an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to that state later.

## 6. Observer

The **Observer** pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes its state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## 7. Visitor

The **Visitor** pattern represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure, allowing defining a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

## 8. Strategy

The **Strategy** pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, allowing the algorithm to vary independently of clients that use it.

- [Learn more about the Strategy](/patterns/behavioral/strategy.md)

## 9. State

The **State** pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, often implemented as a finite state machine.

- [Learn more about the State](/patterns/behavioral/state.md)

## 10. Template Method

The **Template Method** defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation but allows subclasses to redefine parts of the algorithm without changing its structure.

Each of these behavioral design patterns addresses specific issues in communication and collaboration between objects in a software system. By understanding these patterns, you can design more flexible and maintainable systems in JavaScript.
