### Abstract Factory

In software design, the Abstract Factory design pattern is a technique used to create families or groups of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern provides a way to encapsulate a set of individual factories that share a common theme without needing to know the details of the exact classes of the objects that will be created. This promotes consistent and modular object creation, making code management and extension easier.

**Example:**

To better understand the Abstract Factory pattern, let's consider an example related to preparing beverages, such as tea and coffee.

**Step 1:** We define base classes and subclasses to represent beverages, in this case, Beverage, Tea, and Coffee.

```
class Beverage {
  consume() {
    // Abstract method, to be implemented in subclasses
  }
}

class Tea extends Beverage {
  consume() {
    console.log('This is Tea');
  }
}

class Coffee extends Beverage {
  consume() {
    console.log('This is Coffee');
  }
}
```

**Step 2:** We define the base factory class (BeverageFactory) and factory subclasses (TeaFactory and CoffeeFactory) that will be used to create specific beverages.

```
class BeverageFactory {
  prepare(amount) {
    // Abstract method, to be implemented in subclasses
  }
}

class TeaFactory extends BeverageFactory {
  makeTea() {
    console.log('Tea is prepared');
    return new Tea();
  }
}

class CoffeeFactory extends BeverageFactory {
  makeCoffee() {
    console.log('Coffee is prepared');
    return new Coffee();
  }
}
```

**Step 3:** In this step, we create an instance of the tea factory (teaBeverageFactory), use it to create a tea beverage (tea), and finally, consume the tea beverage, which produces the expected console output.

```
let teaBeverageFactory = new TeaFactory(); // Create a tea factory
let tea = teaBeverageFactory.makeTea(); // Use the factory to create a tea beverage
tea.consume(); // Consume the tea beverage

// Expected Output:
// Tea is prepared
// This is Tea
```

**Final Code:**

```
// Definition of base classes and subclasses
class Beverage {
  consume() {
    // Abstract method, to be implemented in subclasses
  }
}

class Tea extends Beverage {
  consume() {
    console.log('This is Tea');
  }
}

class Coffee extends Beverage {
  consume() {
    console.log('This is Coffee');
  }
}

// Definition of the base factory class and factory subclasses
class BeverageFactory {
  prepare(amount) {
    // Abstract method, to be implemented in subclasses
  }
}

class TeaFactory extends BeverageFactory {
  makeTea() {
    console.log('Tea is prepared');
    return new Tea();
  }
}

class CoffeeFactory extends BeverageFactory {
  makeCoffee() {
    console.log('Coffee is prepared');
    return new Coffee();
  }
}

// Example of usage
let teaBeverageFactory = new TeaFactory(); // Create a tea factory
let tea = teaBeverageFactory.makeTea(); // Use the factory to create a tea beverage
tea.consume(); // Consume the tea beverage

// Expected Output:
// Tea is prepared
// This is Tea
```
