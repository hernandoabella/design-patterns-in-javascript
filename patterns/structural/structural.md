# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns focus on the composition of classes and objects to form more complex structures. They use inheritance and interface composition to create efficient and flexible relationships between entities.

Below are the most common structural design patterns in JavaScript:

## 1. Adapter

The **Adapter** pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It converts the interface of one class into another that the client expects. It's useful when you need objects with different interfaces to collaborate.

## 2. Bridge

The **Bridge** pattern separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to evolve independently. It's useful when you want to avoid a permanent bond between an abstraction and its implementation.

## 3. Composite

The **Composite** pattern composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows treating individual objects and object compositions uniformly.

## 4. Decorator

The **Decorator** pattern dynamically adds functionality to existing objects without modifying their structure. It's useful when you want to extend an object's functionality flexibly.

## 5. Facade

The **Facade** pattern provides a simplified interface for a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It makes using complex systems easier by providing a more user-friendly interface.

## 6. Flyweight

The **Flyweight** pattern minimizes memory or disk storage usage by sharing as much as possible with similar objects. It's useful when you need to manage a large number of objects with efficient resource usage.

## 7. Proxy

The **Proxy** pattern provides a substitute or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It can be used to add additional functionality like access control or lazy loading.

Each of these structural design patterns offers efficient and flexible solutions for creating relationships between classes and objects in JavaScript projects. By understanding these patterns, you can design more modular and maintainable systems.
